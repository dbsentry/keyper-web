## OpenSource Projects

### [Keyper](https://github.com/dbsentry/keyper-docker)
Keyper is an SSH Key/Certificate Authentication Manager. It standardizes and centralizes the storage of SSH public keys and SSH Public Certificates for all Linux users within your organization saving significant time and effort it takes to manage SSH public keys and certificates. Keyper is a lightweight container taking less than 100MB. It is launched either using Docker or Podman. Keyper has three sub-projects: [keyper-docker](https://github.com/dbsentry/keyper-docker), [keyper](https://github.com/dbsentry/keyper), and [keyper-fe](https://github.com/dbsentry/keyper-fe).

### [SSHFP Tester](https://github.com/dbsentry/sshfp) 
SSHFP is SSHFP record tester. It lists SSHFP records, SSH Key Fingerprints for a server, and matching Key fingerprints between the published DNS SSHFP records and Fingerprints returned by the SSH server. SSHFP records are obtained by performing DNS lookup against the domain's authoritative name servers, so changes to SSHFP records should show up instantly. This tool extracts SSH Key Fingerprints using ssh-keyscan against the server and port. Result also includes a set of matching keys between published DNS SSHFP records and Key fingerprints returned by the SSH server. You should use DNSSEC when publishing SSHFP records. And, you should only perform this test against the server you own. You can see the demo [here](http://sshfp.herokuapp.com/#/dashboard).
